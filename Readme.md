# Login-logout project

I have used **Node.js + express + MongoDB** to create an successfull login-logout application.

## Used https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas for database.

## Download and run below commands to see the working application

- $ npm install
- In config/keys.js update the value of MongoURI as per your account in mongodb. 
**Note:** Do not forget to add the passport and dbname.
**Warning:** If you are receiving an bad authentication error, chnage your password to the simple string, special characters in password can create an complications in this case.
- $ npm start 
- Visit localhost
